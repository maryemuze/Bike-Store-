  ## Data Analysis
  I started off by loading the dataset into Google sheet. I cLeaned the dataset by identifying and removing duplicates records. 1000 duplicates rows were found. And the I proceeded with the analysis by first calculating the Total Revenue and I found out that the store had a Total Revneue of 84,826,772. In order to get the Country that generated the most revenue, I visualized it with a Column chart and I discovered that United States generated most revenue followed by Australia. By exploring which product category made most sales, I also visualized it with a Pie chart. I discovered Bikes made more sales followed by Accessories and the least sales was Clothing.A chart was created to find out which Age group generated the most sales. The Age group (Adults (35-64)) made most sales and the least sales was the Seniors (64+). I discovered that the gender that bought more from the Bike store was the Male gender which had a percentage of 50.8% and the female had 49.2%.
