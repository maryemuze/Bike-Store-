  ## Data Sources
 Sales data: The primary dataset used for this analysis is the " Bike Sales.csv" file containing detailed information about the sale made by the company.

  ## Tools Utilized
  - Google Sheet  [[download here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Gxi9h1LIbEG0JLmAZWIkO0hbcnkV8D7SPyBR98yyeY0/edit?gid=1927331285#gid=1927331285))
  ## Data Analysis
  I started off by loading the dataset into Google sheet. I cLeaned the dataset by identifying and removing duplicates records. 1000 duplicates rows were found. And the I proceeded with the analysis by first calculating the Total Revenue and I found out that the store had a Total Revneue of 84,826,772. In order to get the Country that generated the most revenue, I visualized it with a Column chart and I discovered that United States generated most revenue followed by Australia. By exploring which product category made most sales, I also visualized it with a Pie chart. I discovered Bikes made more sales followed by Accessories and the least sales was Clothing.A chart was created to find out which Age group generated the most sales. The Age group (Adults (35-64)) made most sales and the least sales was the Seniors (64+). I discovered that the gender that bought more from the Bike store was the Male gender which had a percentage of 50.8% and the female had 49.2%.

## Recommendations
- Using the Revenue by Month Chart, December likely benefitted from holiday shopping. The company should create special holiday packages, offer gift cards, and run festive marketing campaigns.
June likely saw an increase due to summer activities. I'd recommend that the company promote outdoor biking events, summer sales, and family biking packages.Ensure popular products are well-stocked during peak months to meet increased demand.Offer discounts and promotions during the slower months to attract budget-conscious customers.
- United States and Australia:These countries generated the most revenue. The company should invest in high-impact marketing campaigns, including digital ads and targeted promotions.
Partner with local biking clubs, participate in events, and sponsor local races to increase brand visibility and engagement. Canada, France, Germany, and United Kingdom should conduct market research to understand the preferences, needs, and pain points of customers in these regions. Partner with influencers to increase brand awareness and credibility.Offer introductory discounts, loyalty programs, and referral incentives to attract new customers and encourage repeat purchases.
- Adults (35-64) and Young Adults (25-34) made more sales. The company should develop marketing campaigns that resonate with the lifestyle and interests of these age groups. Highlight the health benefits, recreational aspects, and potential for commuting to appeal to these customers. Implement loyalty programs to encourage repeat purchases. 
 Seniors (64+) and Youth (<25): Offer products that cater specifically to these age groups. For seniors, focus on comfort and safety features, such as easy-to-use bikes, electric bikes with comfortable seating, and lightweight frames. For youth, promote trendy designs, safety gear, and starter bike packages. The company should educate these groups on the benefits of biking. For seniors, emphasize the health and mobility benefits. For youth, focus on the fun, social aspects, and benefits of biking as an eco-friendly transportation option."

## Conclusion
By following these insights and recommendations, the company can enhance its sales strategies, optimize product offerings, and better meet the needs of its diverse customer base. This analysis provides a strong foundation for making data-driven decisions that will drive future growth and success.
